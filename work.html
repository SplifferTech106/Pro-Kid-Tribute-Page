          <p>Linda Mkhize (aka 'Pro formerly known as ProKid) born 25 June 1981,</p>
          <p>is a Hip Hop artist from Soweto, South Africa.</P>
          <p>He was signed to Gallo Record Company after his independently released track 'Soweto' became popular.</p>
          <p>His popularity is largely because he proudly represents South African 'Kasi' (Township) life, rapping in a mixture of vernacular and English.</p>
          <p>He believes that rhyming should not be language based but what matters is the delivery, how one can share what they want to share with the people.</p>
          <p>â€œFor me rhyming goes beyond choosing a language I feel comfortable with.</p>
          <p>There are things you can loose when using vernacular yet there are things that sound right when using African languages".</p>
          <p>Pro has his own unique voice and persona. He also says that the way each artist defines themselves, makes their rhyming different.</p>
          <p>It is because of this influence that Pro does not have a formal, strategic way of writing lyrics.</p>
